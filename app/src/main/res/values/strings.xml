    <string name="after_witnessing_the">After witnessing the degrading conditions of stray animals, who are forced to live in unhygienic conditions without sufficient food, it became an earnest need to form an organization dedicated towards the animal welfare and start animal rescue in Lucknow, India. We are blessed with a rational mind that is capable enough to differentiate between right and wrong. We are also endowed with a gift that no other species is blessed with, the gift Of Speech. We are granted the power of words to express our sufferings and feeling. But unfortunately, our fellow mute companions have been deprived from these favours. They silently devour all the wrongs and injustices caused to them. Being the member of the superior race, it’s our moral responsibility to speak for them. Being provided with a resourceful mind, it’s our sole duty to furnish them with the basic amenities like food, shelter, medication, etc. We are doing animal rescue in Lucknow, India which is for the stray animals of the city. Apart from the basic amenities, animals also look for love and compassion. They crave for warmth and empathy from human beings. They need an organization which will not only provide them a roof to live, but also with the necessary care and companionship. Jeev Aashraya, Kanha Upvan is an animal shelter which gives a roof to thousands of animals. Our most recent program promotes dog adoption in Lucknow.</string>

There is no point of living, if we are leading a life fulfilling our own needs and desires. A life which is immortal is the one which is devoted to the service of all the life forms. Our organisation has been working unendingly for the prosperity of the stray animals. We are doing all we can for the sake of the animals, who are not blessed with the gift of speech. A calf has been found having an injury in his hoof. He wasn’t able to walk properly. Currently he is being treated with all the suitable medications, by our veterinary team.
